        <h1>History</h1>
            <p>In <b>Ancient Greece</b>, all art and craft was referred to by the same 
            word, <i>Techne</i>. Thus, there was no distinction between the arts. 
            Ancient Greek art brought the veneration of the animal form and the
            development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty,
            and anatomically correct proportions. Ancient Roman art depicted 
            gods as idealized humans, shown with characteristic distinguishing 
            features (i.e. Zeus' thunderbolt). In Byzantine and Gothic art of
            the Middle Ages, the dominance of the church insisted on the expres-
            sion of biblical and not material truths. Eastern art has generally 
            worked in a style akin to Western medieval art, namely a 
            concentration on surface patterning and local colour (meaning the
            plain colour of an object, such as basic red for a red robe, rather 
            than the modulations of that colour brought about by light, shade 
            and reflection). A characteristic of this style is that the local 
            colour is often defined by an outline (a contemporary equivalent is 
            the cartoon). This is evident in, for example, the art of India, 
            Tibet and Japan. Religious Islamic art forbids iconography, and
            expresses religious ideas through geometry instead.</p>
        <h2>Disciplines</h2>
            <p>In the <strong>Middle Ages</strong>, the <em>Artes Liberales</em>
            (liberal arts) were taught in universities as part of the Trivium, 
            an introductory curriculum involving grammar, rhetoric, and logic,[3] 
            and of the Quadrivium, a curriculum involving the "mathematical arts"
            of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy.[4] The Artes Mechanicae
            (consisting of vestiaria – tailoring and weaving; agricultura – 
            agriculture; architectura – architecture and masonry; militia and
            venatoria – warfare, hunting, military education, and the martial 
            arts; mercatura – trade; coquinaria – cooking; and metallaria – 
            blacksmithing and metallurgy)[5] were practised and developed in 
            guild environments.</p>
        <h3>Visual Arts</h3>
            <p><b>Painting</b>, taken literally, is the practice of applying 
            <i>pigment</i> suspended in a vehicle (or medium) and a binding agent
            (a glue) to a surface (support) such as paper, canvas, wood panel or 
            a wall. However, when used in an artistic sense, it means the use of
            this activity in combination with drawing, composition and other 
            aesthetic considerations in order to manifest the expressive and 
            conceptual intention of the practitioner.</p>
